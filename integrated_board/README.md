# Integrated Board
This is the first iteration of test hardware for unav2. The board includes a STM32F405 and two DRV8871 drivers.
It supports motor current feedback using two INA186 and global battery current/voltage monitor using an INA219.
Additionally there is an LM75 temperature monitor ic and a fan output.
